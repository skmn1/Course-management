## Introduction
Course management is an Odoo fully fledged application that allows training centers to manage their courses. The module is still under development. However, the current version contains almost every needed functionality. This module is compatible with Odoo 12. Therefore, I invite you to download the module and test it. I will be glad to receive your feedback.
